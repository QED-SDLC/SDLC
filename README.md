Our SDLC is considered a strategic knowledge asset, not a static document. Our approach to our SDLC reflects the Australian Government’s expectations around openness, reuse, and digital maturity, particularly as outlined in the Productivity Commission’s "Harnessing Data and Digital Technology" interim report.

Specifically, we support these principles: 

* Manageable: Easily updateable with versioning, moderation, and change tracking 
* Collaborative: Supports input and contribution from a wide range of roles and stakeholders 
* Consumable: Easy to navigate, read, and understand for technical and non-technical audiences 
* Open: Read-accessible by other departments, vendors, partners, and the public 
* Importable: Can be reused across other channels, documentation platforms, or wikis. From Developer Portal and SharePoint to Content Manager and beyond. 
* Extensible: Uses open, structured formats (e.g. Markdown, Text) with no vendor lock-in 
* Sustainable: Owned and maintained like a product, with clear governance and ongoing stewardship 
* Versioned: Changes are traceable, with stable references for teams and auditors 
* Discoverable: Easy to find and search, with links to related content and resources 
* Contextual: Able to adapt to different use cases, roles, or delivery methods 
* Human-readable: Written in plain, purposeful language that respects readers’ time and focus 
* Machine-readable: Structured for use by chatbots, APIs, feeds, and automation tools 
* Trusted: Transparent in authorship, contribution history, and source references 
* Aligned with national policy: Reflects open government principles such as 'data as an asset', 'open by default', and 'supporting standardised, reusable formats' 
* Treated as an asset: Considered a reusable, shareable, measurable knowledge asset that delivers ongoing value beyond its original creation
